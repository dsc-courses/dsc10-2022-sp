    "- However, this estimate is random, because our sample is random, and so it could have looked different.\n",
    "- In order to know whether our estimate is reliable, we'd like to look at its distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **The distribution of a sample looks a lot like the distribution of the population it was drawn from.**\n",
    "- So, we can repeatedly **resample** from our original sample, and compute the estimate (e.g. median) on each of these resamples to create a **bootstrapped** distribution of our estimate.\n",

    "- But if someone asks, \"what's your best guess of the population parameter?\" we're not going to give them our bootstrapped distribution. Instead, we may want to give them a range, or **interval**, of likely values.\n",
    "- Next time, we'll formalize the notion of a confidence interval, and will talk about the idea of percentiles along the way."

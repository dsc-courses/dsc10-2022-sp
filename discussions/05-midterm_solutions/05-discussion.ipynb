    "The fine print of the Sun God festival website says “Ticket does not guarantee entry. Venue subject to capacity restrictions.” RIMAC field, where the 2022 festival will be held, has a capacity of 20,000 people. Let’s say that UCSD distributes 21,000 tickets to Sun God 2022 because prior data shows that 5% of tickets distributed are never actually redeemed. Let’s suppose that each person with a ticket this year has a 5% chance of not attending (independently of all others). What is the probability that at least one student who has a ticket cannot get in due to the capacity restriction? Fill in the blanks in the code below so that prob angry student evaluates to an approximation of this probability.\n",
